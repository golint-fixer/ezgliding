Applications, Tools and Libraries for Glider Pilots

## Status

**PREALPHA**

Ongoing work on the first set of tools and libraries:

* welt2000 data collection (airfields, waypoints)
* soaringweb data collection (airspace)
* netcoupe flight crawling and collection
* flight parsing and analysis

## What

A set of applications and libraries useful for glider pilots.

This includes tools for:

* Backend data collection and management (airfields, airspace, waypoints, ...)
* Flight analysis (igc parsing) and optimization
* Flight data storage and management

It also includes a web application, which is its most visible part.

## How

ezgliding.com only requires a modern browser (we suggest Chrome).

The actual libraries and tools are written in Go.
